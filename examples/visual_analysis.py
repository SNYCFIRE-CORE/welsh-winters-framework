    "Let's implement a CNN using PyTorch. We need to define the convolutional layers and pooling operations.",

    # Week 4-5: Mastery emerging
    "I've optimized the model architecture and achieved 94% validation accuracy using transfer learning from ResNet50.",
    "Implemented data augmentation pipeline with random rotations, flips, and color jittering to prevent overfitting.",
