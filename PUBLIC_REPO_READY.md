```
ðŸŽ¯ Introducing the Welsh-Winters Balance Framework - A Quantitative Approach to AI Hallucination Prevention

After analyzing 105,000+ human-AI conversation turns, we've discovered measurable patterns that correlate with reduced hallucination and improved collaboration outcomes.

Key insights:
â€¢ Successful collaborations follow a predictable lifecycle
â€¢ Balance between technical/emotional language matters
â€¢ Measurable metrics can predict and prevent AI hallucination

Now available as open-source: [GitHub link]
