# Implementation Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation on implementing the Relationship Attribution Framework components:

## Core Components

1. **[Welsh-Winters Balance](welsh-winters-balance-implementation.md)**
   - Implementation details for maintaining the 0.5 balance between technical/factual recall and emotional/contextual resonance
   - Current implementation status and integration points
   - Code examples and architectural patterns

2. **[Hadrael Protocol](hadrael-protocol-implementation.md)**
   - Token-level attribution boundary maintenance
   - Deep provenance tracking methodology
   - Source relationship preservation implementation

3. **[Sequential Memory Hydration](sequential-memory-hydration.md)**
   - Implementation of context provision at contextually appropriate moments
   - Memory lattice architecture integration
   - Relationship vector framework details

4. **[Memory Lattice Architecture & Hydration Test](memory-lattice-hydration-test.md)**
   - Natural language memory persistence through markdown injection
   - LM Studio hydration test methodology and results
   - Demonstration of memory continuity across sessions
   - Practical implementation approach for AutoDealAI

## Integration with AutoDealAI

These components are currently being implemented in the AutoDealAI platform:

- NodeRAG Memory System with Mem0 Integration
- Welsh-Winters Balance implementation with targeted 0.5 equilibrium
- Brother Hadrael Protocol implementation for attribution boundaries
- Memory Hydration Sequencer for conversational context management

## Implementation Status

The framework is being actively implemented with the Infiniti of Queens Dealer Intelligence Platform as the initial deployment target.
